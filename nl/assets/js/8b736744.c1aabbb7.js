It is simple, performant, and has a lot of tools available. However, it does lack flexibility and type safety, which can result in slower queries and potential bugs. Despite its limitations, REST remains a popular choice for API developers due to its simplicity and performance. It is important for developers to carefully consider the trade-offs between REST and other options such as GraphQL when choosing the best solution for their specific needs. For example if you need a defined schema to which both the client and the back-end can adhere, GraphQL might be a better choice. However, if you need a simple, performant, and widely adopted solution, REST might be a better choice."),(0,n.kt)("ul",null,(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://blog.logrocket.com/graphql-vs-rest-api-why-you-shouldnt-use-graphql"},"REST Complexity")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://nordicapis.com/20-impressive-api-economy-statistics/#:~:text=93.4%25%20of%20API%20Developers%20Are%20Still%20Using%20RESTtext=However%2C%20REST%20remains%20the%20most,a%20staggering%2093.4%25%20adoption%20rate."},"Nordic API's"))))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
