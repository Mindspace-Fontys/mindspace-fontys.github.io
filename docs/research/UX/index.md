## Criteria 

By considering these criteria, you can design a reservation system that meets the needs of your target users, is easy to use and navigate, and meets the business requirements of the organization.

- [User goals and tasks](goals):  Identify the key tasks that users will want to accomplish when reserving a space. This will help you design a system that is intuitive and easy to use.

- [User demographics](demographics): Consider the demographics of your target users, including their age, gender, profession, and experience with similar reservation systems. This information will help you design a system that meets their needs and preferences.

- [User feedback](feedback): Gather feedback from users of the (current) reservation system, if available, to understand their pain points and areas for improvement.

- [User interface design](uid): Evaluate the user interface design of similar reservation systems to identify best practices and areas for improvement. Consider factors such as ease of use, visual appeal, and accessibility.

- [System functionality](functionality): Identify the key features and functionality that users will need in the reservation system, such as search filters, calendar views, and notifications.

- [Technical requirements](technicalreqs): Consider the technical requirements of the reservation system, such as compatibility with different devices and browsers, and the need for data security and privacy.
