## Key Considerations

To make the reservation system easy to use, here are some key considerations that are taken:

âœ¨ **User-Friendly Interface:** The reservation system should have a user-friendly interface with clear and intuitive navigation. It should be easy for users to find what they need and to understand how to interact with the system.

ðŸŒ± **Simple and Clear Language:** The language used within the system should be simple and clear, avoiding technical jargon or confusing terms. Instructions and information should be presented in a way that is easy to understand for users with limited IT experience.

ðŸŽ¯ **Limited Steps and Decision Points:** The reservation process should be streamlined to minimize the number of steps required and the number of decision points presented to users. This will help to reduce confusion and make the process more efficient.

ðŸ’¬ **Visual Aids and Feedback:** The reservation system should provide visual aids and feedback to guide users through the reservation process. This can include progress bars, confirmation messages, and error messages to ensure that users are on the right track.

By incorporating these design considerations, the reservation system can be made as easy to use as possible for users with limited IT experience. This will help to ensure that the system is accessible and usable for all users, regardless of their technological proficiency.
