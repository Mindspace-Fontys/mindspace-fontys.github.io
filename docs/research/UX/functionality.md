# System functionality

To create a reservation system that meets the needs of users, it is essential to identify the key features and functionality that they will require. Based on our research and user feedback, some of the features and functionality that we have identified include:

🔍 **Search filters:** Users will need the ability to search for available resources based on specific criteria, such as location, date, time, and equipment requirements. The search filters should be easy to use and navigate, allowing users to quickly find what they need.

📅 **Calendar views:** Users will need a clear and concise view of available resources, including the ability to view resources by day, week, or month. The calendar view should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly identify available resources.

📢 **Notifications:** Users will need to be notified of important updates, such as changes to reservations or availability of resources. Notifications should be delivered in a timely and efficient manner, using email or mobile notifications.

✅ **User roles and permissions:** Users will require different levels of access and permissions based on their roles within the organization. The reservation system should support different user roles, such as administrators, managers, and staff, with the appropriate level of access and permissions for each role.

📈 **Reporting and analytics:** Users will need to access reports and analytics to monitor resource utilization and availability, as well as to identify trends and areas for improvement. The reservation system should include robust reporting and analytics capabilities that are easy to use and navigate.
