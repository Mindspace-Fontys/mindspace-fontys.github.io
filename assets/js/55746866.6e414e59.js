The best use case for GraphQL is when you need a defined schema to which both the client and the back-end can adhere. For instance, when the front-end and back-end teams are two separate teams, GraphQL can be very useful. Because there doesn't need to be any communication between the 2 teams once the schema is defined and honored.
