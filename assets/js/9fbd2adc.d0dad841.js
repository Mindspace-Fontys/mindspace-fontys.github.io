Each function performs a specific task when triggered by an event, such as an incoming email or an HTTP request. After testing, developers deploy their functions and triggers to a cloud provider account. When a function is invoked, the cloud provider executes it on a running server, or spins up a new server for execution if none are running. This execution process is abstracted from developers' view, who can concentrate on writing and deploying the application code.
